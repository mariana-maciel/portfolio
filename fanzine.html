                <p>For this project, our team created a unique fanzine dedicated
                    to Monsters, an experimental magazine born during our Professional
                    Exploration week at IADE. This fanzine celebrates the visionaries
                    of the design world, the rare “monsters” capable of pushing 
                    creative boundaries, each a master of their craft. Inspired by 
                    the transformative work of these giants, we set out to honor their
                    impact through a collection of pages that not only reflect their 
                    legacy but also serve as an experimental piece of art in itself. 
                    By capturing the extraordinary spirit of these design icons, each 
                    fanzine offers a fresh perspective, allowing us to express our 
                    admiration for their contributions in a format that's both bold 
                    and unconventional.

            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>
                For our edition, we chose to highlight the work of Paula Scher, a renowned
                designer from Pentagram known for her pioneering use of typography and impactful, 
                large-scale graphic designs. Our team delved into her career and creative journey,
                exploring how she has redefined modern graphic design and influenced countless 
                creatives worldwide. After our research, we transformed these insights into a 
                set of layouts that reflect her unique style, preparing our Adobe Illustrator
                file meticulously for silk screen printing. By using just two colors, pink and black
                with white, we embraced the limitations of this medium, using contrasts
                to bring our tribute to life in a bold way that echoes Scher's
                unmistakable visual language.
