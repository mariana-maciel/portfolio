                <p>The Otherworld is a story-based board game designed to help players escape the stresses of everyday
                    life and connect with family and friends. In today's fast-paced world, stress levels are rising as
                    people juggle work and school. My game seeks to address this issue by creating a space where players
                    can immerse themselves in a fantasy universe, momentarily forgetting about the pressures of reality.

                    Drawing inspiration from the magical worlds like Disney, I created a game where
                    players take on the roles of protectors and villains, each with a unique backstory. This not only
                    enriches the gameplay but also helps players disconnect from real-world problems by diving into a
                    fully developed fantasy world.

            <p>
                The game's mechanics revolve around collecting gems, setting traps, and making strategies with teammates.
                The players, split into two teams, either work to protect the powerful character Bloom or attempt to steal 
                her powers. This introduces a level of strategy, where players must not only focus on their own progress 
                but also anticipate and block their opponents' moves. This was a challenging project because the main objective 
                of this was to do most of it by hand.

                One of the key features of the game is its two-level board design. The upper level represents the village 
                where the characters live, while the underground level introduces an additional challenge. This dynamic 
                structure makes the game more engaging, as players navigate between the two levels during gameplay. Another 
                important feature is the rotating game board, which allows all players easy access without having to move around 
                the table. 
            </p>
            <p>
                During the prototyping phase, I experimented with various materials and designs to ensure the best gameplay 
                experience. The tokens, crafted from balsa wood, were chosen for their lightweight durability, while the board itself 
                was built using K-line and wood to make it stable yet easy to handle. Testing the game with friends and family helped 
                refine the rules and address issues such as trap placement and gem distribution. This process of iteration was essential 
                in making sure the game was both enjoyable and functional.
