                <p>For my short film project in high school, we had the opportunity to create our own storyline and 
                    write the entire script over a span of three weeks. Our group chose to focus on a 
                    heartfelt story about a young boy living with his older brother. The plot revolves 
                    around the boy's birthday, a day that should be filled with joy, but instead 
                    highlights the emotional distance between the siblings. The brother, often absent 
                    from the boy's life, leaves a letter and a gift, a teddy bear, as a birthday present. 
                    However, the boy, having grown used to being independent due to his brother's absence, 
                    feels disconnected from the gift. His closest companion is XÃ©rife Evaristo, a stuffed
                     pig who has become his best friend in the absence of his brother's attention.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout the film, the audience witnesses the boy grappling with his emotions. 
                    He projects his feelings of loneliness and frustration onto the teddy bear, a symbol 
                    of his brother's neglect, leading to a series of chaotic moments where the boy's inner 
                    turmoil spills over. The film builds toward a powerful climax when the older brother 
                    returns home, horrified by the mess and finally confronted with the emotional impact 
                    his absence has had on his little brother. The short film poignantly explores themes 
                    of loneliness, emotional neglect, and the deep desire for connection within families.

            <h1>The Title Logo</h1>
            <p>
                To elevate the visual identity of our short film, I decided to create a custom 
                logo for the title. The goal was to enhance the project not only graphically 
                but also to develop a memorable element that could leave an impact, especially 
                in terms of marketing. The logo is designed to reflect the film's themes, and
                 it serves as a focal point in our promotional material. To make the design
                  more dynamic and engaging, the main logo was created with six variations, which 
                  are animated together to form a GIF used in the film's opening credits, adding 
                  a subtle but effective visual transition.
