            <p> Hiiiii! My name is Mariana Maciel and I'm 20 years old. I'm wrapping up my bachelor's degree
            in Global Design at IADE Faculty of Design, Technology and Communication of Universidade Europeia.
            Over the past six years, I've had the chance to dive into various design fields, gaining a well-rounded
            experience. What surprised me most was discovering a passion for animation and storytelling, things 
            I never expected to enjoy but now absolutely love. I also have a huge passion for Graphic Design
            Despite a few headaches learning Adobe programs (and Blender!), I found my creative rhythm and can't 
            imagine my work without them.</p>
            <p>Beyond my love for design, I love spending time with the people I love. I'm a huge fan of live music and enjoy reading, especially romance and 
            fantasy books. I'm also passionate about cinema. Two of my favorite films are Little Women and The Nightmare
            Before Christmas. I'm always looking to expand my knowledge of art history, constantly inspired by the past
            to fuel my work today. </p>
            <p>Another big part of my life is football. I played for eight years, and I'm a dedicated fan of Sporting Clube
             de Portugal, there's nothing better than catching a game live!</p>
