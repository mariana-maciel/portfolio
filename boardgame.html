            <p>For this task, I had to create a boardgame from scratch. One the of <br> the key factors was the fact
                that we couldn't use any type of digital <br> platforms. All of the board game needed to be done by
                hand. </p>

                <p>The Otherworld is a story-based board game designed to help players escape the stresses of everyday
                    life and connect with family and friends. In today's fast-paced world, stress levels are rising as
                    people juggle work and school. My game seeks to address this issue by creating a space where players
                    can immerse themselves in a fantasy universe, momentarily forgetting about the pressures of reality.
                    <br>Drawing inspiration from the magical worlds like Winx Club and Onward, I created a game where
                    players take on the roles of protectors and villains, each with a unique backstory. This not only
                    enriches the gameplay but also helps players disconnect from real-world problems by diving into a
                    fully developed fantasy world.
