            <h1>The project</h1>
            <p>For this project we had to create a vidio-mapping from scratch. This group work had a goal
                to celebrate the 50th aniversery of the Portuguese Revolution from 1974. Before this event, Portugal
                was under a conservitive regime of António de Oliveira Salasar where normal activities and habits for us
                today
                were complitly forbidden and punished. The main objective was to make people aware of how lucky we are
                nowadays.
                In the beggining of the project we had to choose 2 prohibitions and make our
                theme around these. We decided to choose the forbidden to kiss law and forbidden to plaw cards on the
                train
                law. The challenge was to combine both.

                <p> The animation is composed by six distinct characters, each meticulously designed.
                    The most noticible characteristic is the absence of facial features in all of them,
                    symbolizing not just individual personas but broader groups, making it easier for
                    the audience to connect with the story. They creat two different groups. The King, the Queen, and
                    the
                    two men on the train symbolize the Portuguese people's yearning for freedom,
                    while the Jack and the PIDE police embody the oppressive regime.

            <h1>The Environments</h1>
            <p>
                The short story's setting is divided into three distinct environments, 
                each meticulously crafted to enhance the narrative. The first is a detailed 
                recreation of Lisbon's Santa Apolónia station in the 1950s, with special 
                attention given to the iconic train, "Foguete", which traveled between Lisbon and Porto in 1953. 
                The second setting is a vibrant, cartoonish bar, designed with a colorful, vintage aesthetic 
                that reflects the playful atmosphere of the card world. Lastly, the maze, which links the real 
                and card worlds, uses specialized shaders to maintain a cohesive cartoonish look. In this world, 
                the central characters, King, Queen, and Jack, come to life, adding a whimsical element to the story's 
                visual narrative.
