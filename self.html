                <p>In my project "Self," I sought to explore the human body 
                    through the lens of photography, using abstraction and 
                    symbolism to express the complexity of identity. After 
                    capturing a series of initial photographs, I immersed myself 
                    in the editing process using Adobe Photoshop, experimenting 
                    with superimposition and other techniques to layer textures 
                    and shapes onto the human form. Through numerous iterations, 
                    I arrived at two final images that shared a powerful unifying 
                    element: a pearl. This symbol became the focal point of my 
                    composition, embodying purity and strength, while also serving 
                    as a bridge between the two distinct visual approaches.

                The final composition, titled "The Pearl," reflects a duality 
                of expression within the human experience. While one image embraces 
                a warmer, subtler palette, evoking a sense of introspection and quiet 
                resilience, the second photograph shifts into cooler tones, with vivid 
                contrasts that suggest a more intense, outward force of transformation. 
                Despite their differences in color and mood, both images are unified by 
                the presence of the pearl, which hangs at the center like a metaphor for 
                selfhood. In this context, the pearl symbolizes both fragility and endurance, 
                capturing the tension between vulnerability and inner strength. These works 
                were featured in a virtual exhibition during the COVID-19 pandemic, offering 
                an intimate reflection on the self in a time of isolation.
